# Two Heaps
## Summary
In problems where we are given a set of elements that we can divide into two parts. To solve, we are interesting in knowing the smallest element in one part and the biggest element in the other part. This pattern uses two Heaps to solve these problems: a min heap to find smallest element and a max heap to find biggest element.
