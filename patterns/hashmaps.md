# Hashmaps
## Summary
Hashing is a technique that takes an input and returns a fixed-size output known as a hash value. The hash is (mostly) unique to the given input.

The Hash Function is what converts the input data into a fixed-length value.

Sometimes, two different inputs can produce the same hash value. This is known as a collision.
## Key Characteristics
- Good for quick data retrieval
- Don't have to waste space and can just compare hash values
- Basic operations include Insert, Search, Delete.
