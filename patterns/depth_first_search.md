# Depth First Search
## Summary
DFS is a technique to traverse a tree. Use recursion to keep track of all the previous nodes while traversing.
## Key Characteristics
- Since it uses recursion, space complexity will be $O(h)$ where $h$ is maximum height.
## General Format
```python
def dfs(head):

```
